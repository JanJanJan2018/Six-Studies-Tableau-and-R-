# Six-Studies-Tableau-and-R-

This folder is most files used to create a datatable of six different studies for exploring 
seven diseases of ulcerative colitis (IBS), Crohn's Disease (IBS), uterine leiomyomas (study 1),
uterine leiomyomas (study 2), Lyme disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and COVID-19. 

The tableua dashboard uses filters to select one of the six studies, then a body system, then a gene. 
The gene summary is displayed when hovering over the gene, the fold change values, the groups of healthy,
diseased, treated, etc. mean gene expression values, and the individual gene expression values of each
sample within a group and study. The Tableau link is:
