Cross-linked tissue samples were dounce homogenized in ChIP lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and then low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Samples were resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer 2 (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed again by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and sample recovery by low speed centrifugation at 4°C.

Digestion was quenched with MNase quenching buffer (10mM EDTA, 20mM EGTA) after which samples were briefly sonicated (Misonix, setting 6 [~6 W power output], 3 cycles of 15sec on and 45sec off). Collagen and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20min. Solubilized chromatin was incubated overnight with antibody at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.

Samples were then resuspended in MNase digestion buffer (20mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 125U MNase [Worthington, cat # LS004798]) and incubated at 37°C until 75% mononucleosomal chromatin profile is observable by gel electrophoresis of purified MNase digested DNA. Digestion was quenched with MNase quenching buffer (10mM EDTA, 20mM EGTA) after which samples were briefly sonicated (Misonix, setting 6 [~6 W power output], 3 cycles of 15sec on and 45sec off). Collagen and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20min. Solubilized chromatin was incubated overnight with antibody at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Myometrium and leiomyoma tissue samples were cryopulverized into a fine powder and immediately formaldehyde cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10min at room temperature with rotation and then quenched with 0.15M glycine for 10min at room temperature with rotation. Cross-linked tissue samples were dounce homogenized in ChIP lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and then low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Samples were resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer 2 (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed again by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and sample recovery by low speed centrifugation at 4°C.

Digestion was quenched with MNase quenching buffer (10mM EDTA, 20mM EGTA) after which samples were briefly sonicated (Misonix, setting 6 [~6 W power output], 3 cycles of 15sec on and 45sec off). Collagen and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20min. Solubilized chromatin was incubated overnight with antibody at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.

Cross-linked tissue samples were dounce homogenized in ChIP lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and then low speed centrifugation at 4°C.

Cross-linked tissue samples were dounce homogenized in ChIP lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and then low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Samples were resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer 2 (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed again by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and sample recovery by low speed centrifugation at 4°C.

Digestion was quenched with MNase quenching buffer (10mM EDTA, 20mM EGTA) after which samples were briefly sonicated (Misonix, setting 6 [~6 W power output], 3 cycles of 15sec on and 45sec off). Collagen and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20min. Solubilized chromatin was incubated overnight with antibody at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = KAPA Hyper Prep kit (Kapa Biosystems, cat # KK8502) was used for end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation with TruSeq index adapters, all according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Samples were then resuspended in MNase digestion buffer (20mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 125U MNase [Worthington, cat # LS004798]) and incubated at 37°C until 75% mononucleosomal chromatin profile is observable by gel electrophoresis of purified MNase digested DNA. Digestion was quenched with MNase quenching buffer (10mM EDTA, 20mM EGTA) after which samples were briefly sonicated (Misonix, setting 6 [~6 W power output], 3 cycles of 15sec on and 45sec off). Collagen and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20min. Solubilized chromatin was incubated overnight with antibody at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Myometrium and leiomyoma tissue samples were cryopulverized into a fine powder and immediately formaldehyde cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10min at room temperature with rotation and then quenched with 0.15M glycine for 10min at room temperature with rotation. Cross-linked tissue samples were dounce homogenized in ChIP lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and then low speed centrifugation at 4°C.

In-situ Hi-C protocol was used performed on cross-linked tissue samples with HindIII digestion of chromatin_x000B_for 12-16hrs at 37°C. Labeling of DNA ends was carried out with 28.4μM D-Desthiobiotin-7-dATP and ends were proximity ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Labeled and proximity ligated DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and sheared to a size of 300-500bp using a Covaris S2 focused ultrasonicator followed by a 0.5X-0.9X AMPure XP bead size selection.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = 1.35 x 105 HUtSMCs were combined with crRNA:tracrRNA:cas9:electroporation enhancer mix targeting either non-silencing control or AP-1 (JUN, JUNB, JUND, FOS, and FOSB) and electroporated in a 10μl Neon pipette tip (pulse voltage = 1,500V, pulse width = 10ms, # of pulses = 3) using a Neon electroporation system (ThermoFisher, cat # MPK5000). Fresh smooth muscle cell complete media was then added and cells were allowed to grow to 90% confluence.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cells were cultured in vascular smooth muscle cell complete media (ATCC, cat #s PCS-100-030, PCS-100-042) and grown at 37°C in a humidified cell culture incubator containing 5% CO2.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 16% paraformaldehyde was added to full media-containing HUtSM cell plates to a final concentration of 1% paraformaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 10min and then quenched with 0.125M glycine for 10min at room temperature with rotation. Cross-linked cells were then incubated in ChIP lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and then low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Samples were resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer 2 (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1X Protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, cat # 4693132001]) followed again by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 15min and sample recovery by low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Samples were then resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer 3 (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% sarkosyl) and sonicated in an ice water bath (Misonix, setting 6 [~6 W power output], 12 cycles of 15sec on and 45sec off). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and samples were centrifuged at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20min, with recovery of chromatin-containing supernatant. Solubilized chromatin was incubated overnight with antibody at 4°C with end-over-end rotation.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = KAPA Hyper Prep kit (Kapa Biosystems, cat # KK8502) was used for end-repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation with TruSeq index adapters, all according to manufacturer’s instructions. A 0.6X-0.8X AMPure XP bead (Beckman Coulter, cat # A63881) size selection was carried out after adapter ligation to enrich for sub-nucleosomal DNA fragments followed by 12 cycles of PCR amplification.
!Sample_data_processing = ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome assembly obtained from Ensembl (release 90) using bowtie (v1.2.2; settings: --best -m 1).
!Sample_data_processing = Peak calling was performed with HOMER (v4.10.3, histone peak calling: -tbp 1 -F 4 -style histone)
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: GRCh38
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Reads per genomic content normalization (RPGC, 1x normalization) of BAM files obtained from Bowtie alignments was performed with DeepTools to produce BigWig files.
