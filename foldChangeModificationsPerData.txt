LymeDisease_log2norm.csv doesn't have the FCs added to it

allRawDataCombinedGSE135223_UC_CD.csv has the following FCs:

Also, no FCs in the above UC and CD data.

UL_studyGSE120854_fCs.csv used the regular FC of disease/healthy with no zeros in the means to modify FCs. The gene counts were added to this data for the CNVs of each gene.
