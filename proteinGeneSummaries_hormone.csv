"hormone","COL6A3","ENSG00000163359","This gene encodes the alpha-3 chain, one of the three alpha chains of type VI collagen, a beaded filament collagen found in most connective tissues. The alpha-3 chain of type VI collagen is much larger than the alpha-1 and -2 chains.

"hormone","MED12","ENSG00000184634","The initiation of transcription is controlled in part by a large protein assembly known as the preinitiation complex. A component of this preinitiation complex is a 1.2 MDa protein aggregate called Mediator. This Mediator component binds with a CDK8 subcomplex which contains the protein encoded by this gene, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12), along with MED13, CDK8 kinase, and cyclin C. The CDK8 subcomplex modulates Mediator-polymerase II interactions and thereby regulates transcription initiation and reinitation rates. The MED12 protein is essential for activating CDK8 kinase. Defects in this gene cause X-linked Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, also known as FG syndrome, and Lujan-Fryns syndrome.

Diseases associated with MED12 include Opitz-Kaveggia Syndrome and Ohdo Syndrome, X-Linked.                                            Among its related pathways are Regulation of Wnt-mediated beta catenin signaling and target gene transcription and Regulation of lipid metabolism by Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha).                                            Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include chromatin binding.                                            An important paralog of this gene is MED12L.","Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. This subunit may specifically regulate transcription of targets of the Wnt signaling pathway and SHH signaling pathway.
